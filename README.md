## How can I delete my account?
User account deletion is a manual process right now. Send an email to `support@glitch.com` regarding deletion of your account or you can create a new topic on [Glitch Support](support.glitch.com).

## My project won‚Äôt stop loading. What do I do?
Your project is constantly ‚Äúloading‚Äù because it doesn‚Äôt have an HTTP server set up to host your app, code, website, bot, so on. 
One way to create an HTTP server is to use Express in your main file (index.js, server.js, or main.js).
Tutorial on [creating a make-do web server using Express](https://support.glitch.com/t/discord-bot-project-keeps-restarting/3218/4).

## I deleted my project. How can I get it back?
Whenever you delete a project it‚Äôs not gone forever. It‚Äôs actually really simple to un-delete. One way is to wait for the " Deleted" notification that pops up in your project editor, in which you can then click Undo üí£. This feature is not an original Glitch feature, meaning that it did not exist when Glitch was first released.
The other way of undeleting a project is to simply scroll down to the Deleted Projects :bomb: section of your profile. There you can find a list of every single project that you‚Äôve deleted, and buttons to undelete them.

## Which languages and frameworks are supported on Glitch?
Glitch only supports Node.js, however, it is possible to integrate others.

## Can I make my project stay online?
You may have noticed that glitch projects shut off after about 5min of not being open. This may be an issue for some people. You can solve this be pinging your bot with an external site. People like [uptime robot](https://uptimerobot.com) but others such as [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) work. Note your prject will reboot after 12h but is barely noticable, unless you have a big startup time.
